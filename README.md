#  **Task 1: software configuration**
## **Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?**
### I am Anastasia Shyrkunova, and I am participating in this project because I want to gain new skills in automated testing and connect my career with this direction.
 
### I used to study manual testing, so when I saw Dare IT Challenge: QA Automated Testing, I thought it was a good chance to learn something new, interesting, and useful.

### My goal is to absorb all the material and use it in practice.
